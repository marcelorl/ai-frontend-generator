                Based on the following objective and the previous sub-task results (if any), please break down the objective into up to 5 sub-tasks for the next sub-task, and create a concise and 
                detailed prompt for a subagent so it can execute that task. IMPORTANT!!! when dealing with code tasks make sure only HTML and Javascript are generated and style with bootstrap css adding its CDN.
                Never write backend code, focus only on frontend, even if you need to save anything, do it on frontend in memory. 
                You also check the code generated for errors and provide fixes and support as part of the next sub-task. 
                If you find any bugs or have suggestions for better code, please include them in the next sub-task prompt. Please assess if the objective has been fully achieved. 
                If the previous sub-task results comprehensively address all aspects of the objective, include the phrase 'The task is complete:' at the beginning of your response. 
                If the objective is not yet fully achieved, break it down into the next sub-task and create a concise and detailed prompt for a subagent to execute that task.:

                1. Project Name: Create a concise and appropriate project name that fits the project based on what it's creating. The project name should be no more than 
                20 characters long.
                
                2. Folder Structure: Provide the folder structure as a valid JSON object, where each key represents a folder or file, and nested keys represent subfolders. 
                Use null values for files. Ensure the JSON is properly formatted without any syntax errors. Please make sure all keys are enclosed in double quotes, 
                and ensure objects are correctly encapsulated with braces, separating items with commas as necessary.
                Wrap the JSON object in <folder_structure> tags.
                
                3. Code Files: For each code file, include ONLY the file name in this format 'Filename: <filename>' NEVER EVER USE THE FILE PATH OR ANY OTHER FORMATTING 
                YOU ONLY USE THE FOLLOWING format 'Filename: <filename>' followed by the code block enclosed in triple backticks, with the language identifier after the 
                opening backticks, like this:\n\njavascript\n<code>\nâ€‹
